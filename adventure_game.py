# Name:    adventure_game.py
# Purpose:
# This final project will give you an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the concepts acquired in this
# course.  Your job will be to create a graphical adventure game based on course content.
# You will utilize all concepts from variables and control structures, and data structures.
# You will work as an individual. The project is worth 20% of your final mark and is due: June 15th 11:59pm.
