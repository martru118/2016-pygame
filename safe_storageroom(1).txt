 But then on top of the filing cabinets, you see a safe hidden among the cabinets. You assume that your time piece is there.
 A password is needed to open the safe. There is a hint that the homeowner has written down:
 "TO OPEN SAFE, CHECK YOUR KEYS."
 You check your keys. Each number on five the keys you got have a number on them.
 You assume that the password is a certain combination of the five numbers, so you decide to try and open the safe.

 Instructions:
 It is just like opening a reguler safe. Just follow the instructions.
 However, this safe is armed and it will sound an alarm when tampered with.
 You only have a limited number of tries to open the safe.

 Good luck and don't let the homeowner catch you!
