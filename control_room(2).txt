To unlock the Storage Room, please finish this puzzle first.
By finishing this puzzle, you deactivate the security features for parts of the starship.

Instructions:
Each button is currently disconnected. Connect the buttons by pressing it.
When you press it, the buttons will change colour. This applies to all eight buttons.
Two buttons need to be coloured in order to be connected and each pair must be a different colour from the other pairs.
Only a certain combination of pairs will deactivate the security in the Stroage Room.
The colours are white, red, blue, and green.
The buttons are white by default (0 presses).
1 press = Red
2 presses = Blue
3 presses = Green

Good luck!
